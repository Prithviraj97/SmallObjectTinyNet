# SmallObjectTinyNet
**Lightweight neural network for fast-moving object detection and tracking**  
Combines CNN-based detection with a physics-based prediction module and fusion for real-time performance and interpretability.

### ðŸ“¦ Modules
- `models/`: Tiny CNN detector
- `physics/`: Physics-based motion prediction
- `fusion/`: Combines detection & prediction
- `training/`: Training scripts and utils
- `inference/`: Run tracking & visualize
- `data/`: dataset used for training and testing the model

### ðŸš€ Goals
- Build an efficient, interpretable tracking system
- Enable full mathematical formulation (loss, prediction, fusion)
- Suitable for robotics, UAVs, microcontrollers
